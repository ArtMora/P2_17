## General Sketch

![](IMG3812690036288305170.jpg)

A trivia game currently with 4 categories.\
History \
Sports \
Fun facts \
General Knowledge \
We pick a category and a question is presented with 20 seconds to answer them.

If answered Incorectly the question is highlighted red and the correct answer is highlighted green. \
If answered correctly the correct answer is highlighted in green.

After the done button is pushed the stats page shows how many questions was answered and how many of those were correct for each category. \
the try again button resets the game stats.
